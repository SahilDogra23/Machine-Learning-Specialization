#  Machine Learning Specialization Portfolio  

Hi, I‚Äôm **Sahil Dogra**! 

After a decade in India‚Äôs education sector‚Äîspanning grassroots work to policy-making‚ÄîI transitioned into tech and completed the **Machine Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng (Coursera)**.  

This repository showcases the **projects I built during the specialization**. Each project demonstrates how theoretical concepts translate into practical applications.
